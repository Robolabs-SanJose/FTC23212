# Variable Constraints

Constraints specify the maximum velocities and accelerations allowed in
trajectories generated by Road Runner. Typically, one set of constraints is set
based on the robot's capabilities and used for all trajectories. This works most
of the time, though there may be certain motions that should be executed at a
slower speed (e.g., paths close to obstacles).

## Per-segment Constraints

One way to accomplish a slowdown is by overriding the base constraints over a
specific segment. Let's say you have the trajectory

<!-- sample: uniformConstraints -->

with the base constraints 

<!-- sample: slowedSegmentBase -->

The resulting path will look like

{{< video original >}}

Each of the path-related builder functions (e.g., `splineTo()`) take velocity
and acceleration constraints as optional overrides. Here's a new variation of
the path from before with a modified trajectory:

<!-- sample: slowedSegment -->

{{< video slowedSegment >}}

## Custom Constraints

Alternatively, you can write your own base constraints that give maximum robot
velocity/acceleration depending on the robot's pose, path derivatives, current path, and
current displacement. This velocity constraint slows the robot in a particular
region of the field:

<!-- sample: slowedHalfBase -->

With the same path as the last section, you get the trajectory

{{< video slowedHalf >}}
