## MeepMeep Visualizer

When working with Road Runner, teams may find it helpful to visualize paths
virtually with MeepMeep *prior* to running on a real robot. In particular, it
shows any points where continuity is broken and the robot must come to a
momentary stop. And for 1.0.x, MeepMeep catches tangent-related exceptions on
the `lineToX()` and `lineToY()` methods (and their variants) without needing to
rerun and repush to the robot when testing fixes.

<!-- It can also display velocity, acceleration and position data (as needed) to debug against telemetry from real-life robot runs. -->

To install and use, follow the instructions on the pages below:

* [1.0.x MeepMeep](https://github.com/acmerobotics/MeepMeep)
* [0.5.x MeepMeep](https://github.com/NoahBres/MeepMeep)

A more detailed overview of MeepMeep features is given in [Learn Road
Runner](https://learnroadrunner.com/tools.html#meepmeep).
